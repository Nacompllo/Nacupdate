# Nacupdate: Nacompllo applications update repository

## Why This Repository?

Nacupdate serves as a personal solution to manage updates to Nacompllo applications. This repository was created as an alternative to Google Play update system, prompted by concerns about [recent changes to Google privacy policies](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10788890) towards developers.

Nacupdate allows me to:

1. I safeguard both developer and user privacy from potentially questionable practices of large corporations by avoiding third-party app stores, thus protecting sensitive data and maintaining autonomy over the update process for updates to Nacompllo applications.
2. I implement a straightforward, JSON-based update mechanism.

This repository is not intended for public use, but serves as a central point for updates to Nacompllo applications.
